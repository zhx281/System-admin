  - In this notebook, I am going to demonstrate some simple bash command you can use in linux as a system administrator. The notebook is separate into different small sections:
    - Listing: ls command
    - Change Permission: mkdir and chmod command
    - Change Directory: cd and pwd command
    - Text File Editing: echo and cat command with > and >> operator
    - Looking At Log: grep comand and | operator
    - Killing Process: ps -aux, sort, head and kill command
